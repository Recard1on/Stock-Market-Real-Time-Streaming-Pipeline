# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

### Introduction

This project involves building an end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline using stock market data streamed via Apache Kafka. The project utilizes technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Glue, Athena, and SQL to facilitate data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. The pipeline is designed to process and analyze stock data in real-time, enabling timely insights and supporting data-driven financial decisions.
